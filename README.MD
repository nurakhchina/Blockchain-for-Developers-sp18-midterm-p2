## Midterm Instructions



## Rules


## Testing 
You can verify that your smart contract is implemented correctly with `truffle test`. Be sure to have a ganache server running in a separate terminal.

Refresher: in an empty terminal, run `ganache-cli` to initialize a default ganache server. If you get errors, read the [_ganache_ documentation](https://github.com/trufflesuite/ganache-cli).

### Truffle Console
If you're having trouble passing the tests and would like to play around with the contracts manually:
1. Run `truffle migrate`
2. Run `truffle console`, This will open up a Node JavaScript console that is connected to your ganache server
